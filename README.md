# Spreadsheet-Automations

This repository contain two version of a spreadsheet I've created years ago and was used for years by the company I worked at the time:
  - full version used by our team 
  - simplified version that was given to other teams to use

Since I had to remove all sensitive information I added some placeholder information for visualization purposes. I also left all tabs/data/columns visible for demonstration purposes, but I would recomend hide the information meant for keeping data to make navigation easier.

The spreadsheets hold in cell formulas and vba code created to automate and improve data stored on an internal ticket system between teams. 

Some features are:
  - Automatically genarate information based on filters such as graphics
  - Automatically display information depending on the users acessing the file
  - Automatically created backups 
  - Automatically created e-maiils with text, tables and graphic with the necessary information
