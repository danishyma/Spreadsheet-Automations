# Spreadsheet-Automations
This spreadsheets holds formulas and vba code that I created to automate and improve data stored on an internal ticket system between teams that I had to follow up and create solutions to.

My main job on this project was to improve the teams comunication and give support to be reflected on metrics from the team we worked with as well as support general guidelines to solve costumer related issues. 

For that the company had a spredsheet witch started with around 4 columns, as the time went I grew the data to better visualize the scenarios and follow up with effiancy and so I wouldn't spend so much time working the speadsheet and doing the same taks more times I've started learning formulas and slowly coding to automate almost everything I needed and had more time to focus on other things.

Some features are:
  - Automatically genarate information based on filters such as graphics
  - Automatically display information depending on the users acessing the file
  - Automatically created backups 
  - Automatically created e-maiils with text, tables and graphic with the necessary information
